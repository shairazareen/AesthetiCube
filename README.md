# Azza'h Crafts (Backend Files) ðŸ›’ðŸŽ¨

The backend system represents a comprehensive Django REST Framework implementation designed specifically for handmade craft marketplaces. Built with meticulous attention to both technical robustness and real-world business needs, this architecture powers everything from user authentication to complex sales analytics while maintaining clean, maintainable code organization.

At its core, the system begins with a customized authentication framework that extends Django's AbstractUser model to include essential e-commerce fields like shipping addresses and contact information. This foundation integrates seamlessly with JWT authentication through Django REST Framework's SimpleJWT package, providing secure token-based access with 60-minute expiration periods and refresh capabilities. The authentication flow incorporates an additional layer of security through email verification using time-sensitive OTP codes, which are generated server-side and delivered via configured SMTP services with automatic expiration after five minutes.

Product management forms the heart of the e-commerce functionality, with a carefully designed Product model that supports eleven distinct categories of handmade items ranging from canvas art to jewelry and gift boxes. Each product automatically generates SEO-friendly slug URLs through Django's slugify utility, with intelligent duplicate handling that appends sequential numbers when necessary. The model accommodates rich product descriptions, precise decimal-based pricing, and organized image uploads while maintaining flexibility through nullable fields where appropriate.

The shopping cart system demonstrates particular sophistication in its handling of both guest users and authenticated customers. Anonymous shoppers receive persistent cart codes that survive browser sessions, while registered users benefit from automatic cart association with their accounts. The Cart and CartItem models work in concert to track quantities and calculate real-time totals, with API endpoints providing full CRUD functionality. This architecture shines in its serializer implementations, where the CartSerializer not only presents item data but also handles on-the-fly calculations of subtotals and item counts, significantly reducing frontend computational overhead.

Order processing follows a carefully constructed pipeline that supports cash-on-delivery transactions as a core feature. The system generates human-readable order IDs following an "ORD-" prefix with UUID-derived suffixes, creating memorable yet unique identifiers. Comprehensive order tracking progresses through clear status stages from Pending to Completed, with each order capturing detailed customer information, delivery specifics, and even originating IP addresses for security purposes. The payment model maintains a clean separation between order data and payment records while being deliberately designed for future payment gateway integrations.

Beyond core e-commerce functionality, the system includes a powerful analytics dashboard built on the StoreSales model. This data architecture uses foreign key relationships to Country, Gender, and CustomerType models to enable multidimensional sales analysis. Pre-configured API endpoints transform raw data into visualization-ready formats, answering complex business questions about sales trends by region, customer demographics, or product categories with simple queries. The dashboard's value is further enhanced by specialized serializers that reshape the data for specific analytical views, such as monthly sales comparisons across different countries.

Technical considerations permeate every layer of the implementation. The settings configuration demonstrates production-ready thinking with CORS policies restricted to approved frontend domains, WhiteNoise integration for efficient static file serving, and environment variable management through python-dotenv. Security measures extend beyond authentication to include CSRF protection, secure cookie settings, and proper database query parameterization. The project's deployment readiness shows in its Render.com configuration, with build scripts that handle static file collection and database migrations automatically.

The admin interface provides business owners with intuitive control over operations through customized Django admin configurations. Product managers can filter inventory by multiple categories, update pricing in bulk operations, and monitor stock levels. Customer service teams access order status information, update tracking details, and contact customersâ€”all through permission-controlled views that maintain security while providing necessary functionality.

What makes this backend truly exceptional is how these components interact seamlessly through a carefully designed REST API. Endpoints follow consistent patterns with proper HTTP status codes and JSON response formats, making integration with any frontend framework straightforward. Error handling maintains consistency across all operations, and the serialization layer provides just the right data in each contextâ€”from minimal product listings to detailed order information with nested payment status.

The system's thoughtful architecture extends to its testing and deployment infrastructure. While focusing on the backend, the configuration includes all necessary CORS settings for frontend connectivity and environment-based database configuration that defaults to SQLite for development but seamlessly switches to PostgreSQL in production. The build process incorporates static file collection and database migrations, ensuring consistent deployment across environments.

This backend doesn't merely meet technical requirementsâ€”it anticipates real business needs. The product categorization reflects actual craft marketplace inventory, the analytics provide actionable business insights, and the order processing handles the nuances of handmade goods sales. Every design decision, from the cart persistence method to the dashboard metrics, was made with both technical excellence and practical utility in mind, resulting in a system that's as maintainable as it is powerful.
